# What is ChatKC

ChatKC is a specialized WSS (**W**eb**S**ocket **S**ecure)  chat created by the popular youtuber, [MattKC](https://www.youtube.com/mattkc).<br><br>
ChatKC is different because it uses Google oAuth to authenticate users to the server after sign in.<br><br>
After the user is authenticated, they may chat on the MattKC site, or on an alternative, unofficial specialized client.<br><br>
Work is being done to fully reverse-engineer the ChatKC usage, so that others can make a decentralized network of ChatKC-style servers.<br><br>
